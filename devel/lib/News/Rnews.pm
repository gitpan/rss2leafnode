=head1 NAME

News::Rnews - write to news spool using rnews program

=for test_synopsis my ($message)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $rnews = News::Rnews->new;
 $rnews->write ($message);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<!!! This is of pretty doubtful value.  Unless you really want to use the
leafnode rnews program you're better off with an nntp IHAVE or POST.>

C<News::Rnews> runs the C<rnews> program and writes given news messages to
it.  An NNTP connection is made to the news server too, to suppress messages
already in the spool by C<Message-ID>.

This module has been written for Leafnode version 2, but might perhaps one
day work with INN or Cnews too.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 Message Handling

=over 4

=item C<< $rnews = News::Rnews->new >>

Create and return an Rnews object.

=item C<< $rnews->open >>

Start the C<rnews> subprocess and NNTP connection.  This is done
automatically by the first C<write> (below), so you don't have to do it
explicitly except to be sure in advance of having the necessary connection
and permissions.

=item C<< $rnews->write ($message) >>

Write the given C<$message> to C<rnews>.  If it already exists in the spool
then it's silently discarded.

C<$message> can be a string of bytes which is the message, or a
C<MIME::Entity> or C<MIME::Lite> object.

When building a message or gatewaying from mail note that a C<Path> header
is mandatory, even if it's just some dummy hostname.

=item C<< $rnews->flush ($message) >>

Write any queued messages to the spool now.  This means sending EOF to the
C<rnews> subprocess and checking it finishes successfully.

A new subprocess will be started automatically on the next C<write>.  But
note that starting a new subprocess for a flush like this can be a bit slow
if your groupinfo file is big.

=item C<< $rnews->close >>

Flush messages queued to the C<rnews> program (as per C<flush>), and close
the NNTP connection too.  This is done automatically when the C<$rnews>
object is destroyed (garbage collected) but doing it explicitly lets you be
sure it's successful.

=back

=head2 Other Funcs

=over 4

=item C<< $rnews->message_exists ($message) >>

=item C<< $rnews->message_id_exists ($msgid) >>

Return true if the given message is already in the spool.

C<message_exists> takes a whole message as a byte string, C<MIME::Entity> or
C<MIME::Lite> per C<write> above and its C<Message-ID> header is used.
C<message_id_exists> takes just the message ID string, without any C<E<lt>>
or C<E<gt>> brackets.

Although C<write> automatically discards duplicates, you might want to check
for a duplicate before doing the work of downloading or building a message.
C<message_id_exists> lets you do that conveniently.

=item C<< $rnews->check_perms >>

Check that the C<rnews> program can be successfully run, which usually means
having user C<news> permissions, and die if not.

This is done automatically at the first C<< write >> or C<< open >> (and
then remembered if ok) but can be called explicitly to check earlier.
