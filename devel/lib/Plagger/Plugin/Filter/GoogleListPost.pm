=head1 SYNOPSIS

 - module: Filter::GoogleListPost

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module sets up a List-Post header for use by Publish::Rnews (or
similar) on entries which are Google Groups mailing list messages.  Such
entries are identified from their link like

    http://groups.google.com/group/cfcdev/msg/445d4ccfdabf086b

which becomes

    List-Post: cfcdev@googlegroups.com

Such a List-Post might let your mailer or news reader send a "followup to
mailing list" to the right place.  The link itself is left pointing to the
message.
