=head1 SYNOPSIS

 - module: Filter::YahooLinks

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module flattens a Yahoo redirector link like

    http://au.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/financenews/*http://au.biz.yahoo.com/071003/30/1fdvx.html

down to

    http://au.biz.yahoo.com/071003/30/1fdvx.html

This is good for de-duplicating because the latter is unique, whereas the
redirector link varies with the originating feed when an article appears in
multiple feeds.
