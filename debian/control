# libxml-rss-perl is first in the deps in case that makes apt prefer
# it over libxml-rss-libxml-perl, since the latter will drag in libxml
# too.  But either is fine.
#
# "leafnode | news-transport-system" is only recommended so as not to
# force removal of rss2leafnode if switching news servers, and since
# in theory the $news_host option makes it possible to connect to a
# nearby remote news server.

Description: Post RSS or Atom articles to local newsgroups
 RSS2Leafnode reads specified RSS or Atom feeds and posts items to
 local newsgroups.  It's named for the leafnode program, but can post
 to any server.  The idea is that articles aren't propagated anywhere,
 just a convenient way to get them into a local spool for later
 reading.
