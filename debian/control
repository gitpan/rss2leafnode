Description: Post RSS or Atom articles to local newsgroups
 RSS2Leafnode reads specified RSS or Atom feeds and posts items to
 local newsgroups.  It's named for the leafnode program, but can post
 to any server.  The idea is that articles aren't propagated anywhere,
 just a convenient way to get them into a local spool for later
 reading.
