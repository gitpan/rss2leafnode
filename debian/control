# libxml-rss-perl is first in the deps in case that makes apt prefer
# it over libxml-rss-libxml-perl, since the latter will drag in libxml
# too.  But either is fine.
#
# "leafnode | news-transport-system" is only recommended so as not to
# force removal of rss2leafnode if switching news servers, and since
# in theory the $news_host option makes it possible to connect to a
# nearby remote news server.

Description: Post RSS articles to local newsgroups
 RSS2Leafnode reads specified RSS feeds and posts items to local
 newsgroups.  It's named after the leafnode program, but can post to
 any server.  The intention is that articles aren't propagated
 anywhere, it's just a convenient way to get them into a local spool
 for later reading.
