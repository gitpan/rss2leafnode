This is a place-holder for possible future translations of the few
messages in the rss2leafnode.

Currently there's nothing translated, and the messages probably aren't
settled enough to want to put work into translation.

"charset=" in each .po file should be UTF-8, ready for messages to be
used as Perl wide-char strings.  Other charsets work fine though,
converted at runtime.  Messages for prints etc (which is almost
everything) will go to the tty and should probably be restricted to
characters displayable in the usual locale encoding(s) of the target
language.  The .pot file itself is all ASCII.

header.pot is the start part of RSS2Leafnode.pot, put there by the
generate rules in the Makefile (per inc/MyMakeMakerGettext.pm).
gettext 0.17 doesn't doesn't preserve comments in a .pot header very
well.
