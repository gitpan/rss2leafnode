This is a place-holder for possible future translations of the few
messages in the rss2leafnode.

Currently there's nothing translated, and the messages probably aren't
settled enough to want to put work into translation.

"charset=" in each .po file should probably be the usual locale
charset, ready for messages to go out to the tty.  Other charsets can
be converted at runtime, but the chars used should be displayable on a
tty.  The .pot file is all ASCII.

header.pot is the start part of RSS2Leafnode.pot, put there by the
generate rules in the Makefile (per inc/MyMakeMakerGettext.pm).
gettext 0.17 doesn't doesn't preserve comments in a .pot header very
well.
